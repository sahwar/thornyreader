## About

ThornyReader is a program for rendering EPUB without DRM, FB2, PDF without DRM,
MOBI, DJVU, DOC, DOCX, RTF, CHM and TXT

  - mupdf for PDF, XPS and OXPS
  - djvu for DJVU
- start chosen binary and pass two created FIFO files as arguments
- write requests to first FIFO and read responses from second FIFO

## Build
